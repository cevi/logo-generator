Resolution relative settings. Excerpt from Google web fundamentals:<sup>[1]</sup>

- Create breakpoints based on content, *never* on specific devices, products,
  or brands.
- Design for the smallest mobile device first, then progressively enhance
  the experience as more screen real estate becomes available.
- Keep lines of text to a maximum of around 70 or 80 characters.

Currently defined breakpoints:

```yaml
#{stringify($breakpoints, (separator: "\a"))}
```
